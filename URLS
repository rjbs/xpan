== A brief discussion of XPAN URLs ==

Consider the following argument as an injection for XPAN:

  file:///tmp/Foo-Bar-1.23.tar.gz

XPAN will look first for an explicit injector (^\w+::).  Since none is
given, it will fall back to the default injector for the url, which is
file:///, mapped to XPAN::Injector::File.  This argument would be identical:

  File::file:///tmp/Foo-Bar-1.23.tar.gz

Explicit injectors containing uppercase letters are reserved for XPAN internal
use; all the default injectors have uppercase letters (File, SVN, CPAN, ...).

There may also be user-defined injectors; for example, CPAN with a particular
configuration.  These must be named in all-lowercase, but are otherwise
identical to the default injectors:

  myminicpan::cpan://dist/Foo-Bar/1.23
